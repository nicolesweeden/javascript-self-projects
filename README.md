# javascript-self-projects
This is a repository containing bite-sized JS project(s) that I built during my time as a student at Codeup! Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Technologies implemented in this project are:
✅ HTML 
✅ CSS 
✅ JS
